It worked out well because there are bus lines, that take you as far as subway lines, as well as tram lines, that have more stops but take you around the neighborhood and low speed rail, that can take you to outskirts. Also, all of that is connected through one app on your phone in Munich. 

A lot of fun!

Unless he takes a ferry to Dover. Which he could conceivably do, then take the Eurostar to Paris. I think this is less likely though, because if Ben and Adam see him on that ferry, they will know immediately what his plan is, and could just go to Paris to intercept. It's a logistics game at that point. The ferry is 90 minutes, and the fastest train to Paris another 120, so that's 3.5 hours, and he'll definitely have to do multiple challenges in Dover (the ferry will cost him 900 coins, but the high-speed train will be 3,000 coins, so even though he'd get 750 coins in Dover for completing the curse card, he'd have to add just over 1,300 coins in Dover to pay for a ticket to Paris).

You know...it would almost make more sense to take the ferry to Dover, then take a train to London. He could do a whole bunch of challenges in London and then, after accumulating a lot of coins, he could FLY somewhere, ideally somewhere that has a good rail pathway to Zermatt. The upshot is that there would be no point for Ben and Adam to go to London to catch him. It'd be pointless, because a) once they realize Sam is going to London, it would likely take them a few hours to get there after him, and b) once they got to London, Sam could pick any one of London's 3 major airports to disembark from...or he could even take the Eurostar BACK to France and psych them out.

Ugxn-vYugDi0dsnRluJ4AaABAg,@mfogs1767,"My thoughts on strategy:

Head to Germany ASAP. Germany has public bike sharing (Call a Bike) across ~40 cities. It's unclear whether you can pick up a bike in one city and drop it off in another. If you can, great, that makes things easier‚Äîbut if not, simply bike out into the countryside and start racking up challenges in obscure locations (this part would work in any city that has public bike sharing, not just DE). Start by biking along a major train route for 45 min so it looks like you're on the train (choose a low speed one so your speed looks conceivable; they may sniff this out). Choose a stop as far away that has no bike share and you can get there before they do on the next public transit. Stay there until the next public transit from the starting point departs. Then take off in a direction that has no public transit with your bike. Start racking up challenges, bouncing from place to place that doesn't have easy public transit opportunities in a randomized manner. 

You'll get a TON of points this way. Then - they know you'll have to return to the same city to return your bike. But rather than choosing the main train station or something, find an alternate departure point (e.g. intra-city bus stop, smaller train station, etc.). Get there max 5 min before your departure, fly off into the sunset. Granted, you could still be caught, BUT you have so many more options incl flights for later on based on how many pts you racked up. 

I don't have access to the full rules, but this seems possible based on what's been stated so far (but who knows they're pretty good about rules so it may not be possible). You would obviously have to be a very strong biker as well (I've done ~50 miles on a citi bike and it was a nightmare lol).",2022-09-15T13:59:50Z,my thoughts on strategy head to germany asap germany has public bike sharing call a bike across 40 cities it s unclear whether you can pick up a bike in one city and drop it off in another if you can great that makes things easier but if not simply bike out into the countryside and start racking up challenges in obscure locations this part would work in any city that has public bike sharing not just de start by biking along a major train route for 45 min so it looks like you re on the train choose a low speed one so your speed looks conceivable they may sniff this out choose a stop as far away that has no bike share and you can get there before they do on the next public transit stay there until the next public transit from the starting point departs then take off in a direction that has no public transit with your bike start racking up challenges bouncing from place to place that doesn t have easy public transit opportunities in a randomized manner you ll get a ton of points this way then they know you ll have to return to the same city to return your bike but rather than choosing the main train station or something find an alternate departure point e g intra city bus stop smaller train station etc get there max 5 min before your departure fly off into the sunset granted you could still be caught but you have so many more options incl flights for later on based on how many pts you racked up i don t have access to the full rules but this seems possible based on what s been stated so far but who knows they re pretty good about rules so it may not be possible you would obviously have to be a very strong biker as well i ve done 50 miles on a citi bike and it was a nightmare lol,0.1978186274509804,Positive,"['thought', 'strategy', 'head', 'germany', 'asap', 'germany', 'public', 'bike', 'sharing', 'call', 'bike', 'across', 'city', 'unclear', 'whether', 'pick', 'bike', 'one', 'city', 'drop', 'another', 'great', 'make', 'thing', 'easy', 'simply', 'bike', 'countryside', 'start', 'rack', 'challenge', 'obscure', 'location', 'part', 'would', 'work', 'city', 'public', 'bike', 'sharing', 'de', 'start', 'bike', 'along', 'major', 'train', 'route', 'min', 'look', 'like', 'train', 'choose', 'low', 'speed', 'one', 'speed', 'look', 'conceivable', 'may', 'sniff', 'choose', 'stop', 'far', 'away', 'bike', 'share', 'get', 'next', 'public', 'transit', 'stay', 'next', 'public', 'transit', 'starting', 'point', 'depart', 'take', 'direction', 'public', 'transit', 'bike', 'start', 'rack', 'challenge', 'bounce', 'place', 'place', 'easy', 'public', 'transit', 'opportunity', 'randomized', 'manner', 'get', 'ton', 'point', 'way', 'know', 'return', 'city', 'return', 'bike', 'rather', 'choose', 'main', 'train', 'station', 'something', 'find', 'alternate', 'departure', 'point', 'e', 'g', 'intra', 'city', 'bus', 'stop', 'small', 'train', 'station', 'etc', 'get', 'max', 'min', 'departure', 'fly', 'sunset', 'grant', 'could', 'still', 'catch', 'many', 'option', 'incl', 'flight', 'later', 'base', 'many', 'pt', 'rack', 'access', 'full', 'rule', 'seem', 'possible', 'base', 'state', 'far', 'know', 'pretty', 'good', 'rule', 'may', 'possible', 'would', 'obviously', 'strong', 'biker', 'well', 'do', 'mile', 'citi', 'bike', 'nightmare', 'lol']",2
