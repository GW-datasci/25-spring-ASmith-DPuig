To make that happen, they sabotage the U.S. oil industry by funding anti-fracking and other environmental groups. They‚Äôve turned supporting U.S. oil production into political suicide. The result? No U.S. oil being produced means more money for these other countries.

It‚Äôs the same deal with the UN. They stir up crises and fuel conflicts to keep people fighting each other. They fund armed groups to create the illusion of freedom fighters, while the U.S and other un members state gets stuck footing the bill for the UN. Meanwhile, back home in America, we have a growing homeless problem, and the so-called humanitarian groups are using state and federal funds to keep the cycle going.

Using $3.25/gallon and above threshold, gas was at this level April 2008 to Sept 2008.  This a 6 month spike.  Given the capital investments, one better not be using a 6 month spike as the basis of estimating future gas prices.  It is 3 years later before gas exceed $3.25 and that is March 2011 to Sept 2014.  It was not until Russia invaded Ukraine in Feb 2022 did gas prices spike above $3.25.  The problem with it, gas prices can and do vary, thus the profitability of fracking will move with a positive correlation.  If prices drop significantly, then fracking cuts back on production, with lower production, the ""strawberry"" oil refineries don't have feed.  The refinery has high capital costs and this variability is risk.

And once you add in all of the other electrical energy required to get that gallon of gasoline into a fuel tank, an EV could have travelled closer to 25 miles. Let that sink in, and then realize that EV‚Äôs are not stressing the power grid at all - at most they‚Äôre adding almost insignificant additional demand in cases where a driver replaces a vehicle that averaged more than 25 mpg, and they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt many of those.",2024-11-18T21:48:55Z

Apparently the oxygen to co2 ration was very different during prehistoric times.  co2 was significantly higher. This is just loose theorizing but cold-blooded animals have lower metabolisms which is probably an adaptation which allowed for them to thrive. When the mass extinction event concurred a significant amount of that carbon was sunk into the earth rather than in the atmosphere.  This may have been the catalyst of change for living things to transition to warm-blooded/endotherms. 

If this is the case the energy stored within the earth is simply not viable or sustainable. We are actually reversing the product of an event which gave rise to air breathing animals.

it doesnt make sense to talk about the US's ""energy independence"".  It does make sense to talk about world wide supply.  (Seriously,  what units of measure is ""energy independence "" anyway!?

Ugykf3GBZrMku8ZEiXp4AaABAg,@jagermaestro1,"Sorry but this title is incredibly misleading. I came for some idea of why and just walked away with ""it's complicated"" while receiving a bunch of info I have already heard before.

What does the history of US oil usage have to do with anything about our refineries not being able to refine the type of oil I got? Where is the process and science behind how our oil refineries work? Why the pivot into energy independence? There are certainly options to achieve it, but no effort was put into what those options are and what the cost/benefit is of doing them. Very lazy and entry level for a title that appears to be trying to educate us about a specific piece of the puzzle. ""What does energy independence really mean?"" or something not that it would get the hits but this video certainly doesn't deserve it.

How about some actual research beyond ""it's hard"" and dragging out some professor you enjoy to tell us ""it's hard""? Other channels might give a cost (w/ carbon analysis) of building a new refinery to help justify oil companies claiming they can't or some options on how to deal with oil companies that appear to just not want to engage in good faith with a solution?

When people analyze what alternative energy programs to go with there is build out estimates along with carbon cost, this just feels like you needed to get a video out and wanted to tow some moderate line. Subtle, gradual shifts certainly are popular, but they are not necessarily always correct, you need to analyze the actual changes we could put in place not just blind faith accept the status quo and say, ""well this old man I like said its hard and I trust him"".",2024-10-28T20:48:35Z

Nothing but profits upon profits upon record setting profits upon record setting profits upon record setting profits. Completely overhauling the entirety of American refineries at any point over the past several decades wouldn‚Äôt have been ‚Äòa risky investment‚Äô (an objectively vague and/or obnoxiously slimy way of framing your argument). At any point, going back decades, American oil producers could have completely revamped and upgraded the entirety of their refinery systems with barely a dent to their profit margins. At any point, American oil producers could spend just a fraction of their nonstop record setting profits to easily fulfill American oil usage. It‚Äôs literally harder, more environmentally impactful, and expensive to refine foreign sour crude than American oil. 
***NEWSFLASH*** to genuinely curious Americans searching for reasonable answers to tough questions: oil companies will NOT hesitate to butt-fuck you raw for profit! 
To any genuinely professional engineers, geologists, ect, who may view this, who studied their asses off and made sacrifices to forge a successful livelihood in any field of petroleum production, I sincerely mean you no offense! 
Oil producers ARE NOT A BENEVOLENT FRIEND OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE! 
Profit is the bottom line. Refusing to drill on any of the 9000 plus onshore and offshore land leases they gobbled up, decades of refusing to invest in their own 50-75 year old refineries, to refine the very oil they rape from OUR COUNTRY, are just the basest of indisputable facts. 

THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT YOU. THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT AMERICAN SUCCESS. THEY DON‚ÄôT CARE ABOUT UPGRADING THEIR OWN FACILITIES TO PROPEL THEIR OWN INDUSTRY. 

Oil is a finite resource. Anyone my age that bothered to pay attention in 7th grade social studies understands that planet earth is basically out of oil within at most 50 years. Oil producers couldn‚Äôt care less about you or anyone else. America runs on oil. They know this. Instead of producing more or upgrading refineries, oil companies literally have divisions and buildings full of people solely employed to figure out maximizing profitability.

He said you just have t been informed or someone lied to you bc here in Port Arthur Texas, the BASF steam cracker was a whole refinery that was built, and it was revolutionary for what it did. He didn‚Äôt explain but it was and still is a big deal and extremely significant. I think it was the first or only of its kind. I could be lying now. I‚Äôm not an operator.

It is not a 1:1 exchange of oil types.  In fact we have much more diverse refining capabilities that anyone in the world.

We are perfectly able to acheive energy independence, expecially if we reopen ANWR which is full of light sweet regular crude oil.  

Yes their would be refinery disruptions and needed updates but hardly an issue to confound the transition to inndependence.  Thw issues are more economic than scientific and changes in Regulation and tarrifs could fix those issues very quickly!  So don't buy in th this BS about what can and cannot be done...  What is clear is that we cannot transition to Electric Cars anytime soon because we would have to double the size of the Electric Grid and at least double drivability ranges to even start to make that transision!  

Part 2  We may be able to grow our own carbon neutral fuel in the form of Algae that can be processes into crude oil constituents which solves two problems!  One is Supply the other is Zero Fossil Carbon so Zero Global Warming effects!

It is cheaper to sell the light sweet crude which is easier to refine and has a premium on the market, and buy the heavy sour crude. The difference in price is 10-20 dollars a barrel. You can make that right off the top, that is why we changed the export laws.  We also refine oil for mexico and canada, so it counts as an import, but also as an export as a refined product.

Here are some of the ways petroleum is used in our every day lives. All plastic is made from petroleum and plastic is used almost everywhere: in cars, houses, toys, computers and clothing. Asphalt used in road construction is a petroleum product as is the synthetic rubber in the tires. Paraffin wax comes from petroleum, as do fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides, detergents, phonograph records, photographic film, furniture, packaging materials, surfboards, paints, and artificial fibers used in clothing, upholstery, and carpet backing.

Had to stop the video midstream. Ok, I finished watching after taking a break in disbelief. This video has so many holes and misinformation in it, I DONT know where to start beginning with the title of this video. We don't produce any oil. That production occurs underground at which point we drill and pump that production out of the ground and refine after. And yes, we can and DO use it, i.e., refined into hundreds of products, by products. And No the oil we pump out is not some type of nearly unrefineable ""sludge"" as you tried to characterize it as being. The stuff from tar sands in Canada might be closer to that description though. The fact of the matter is completely the opposite as far as oil pumped from the Permian Basin goes but more on that separately. In fact it has its own separate name and category, West Texas Intermediate Light Crude, low density, and low sulphur content making it some of the finest crude oil that it is one of three benchmarks that set the price of crude petroleum in the world market. Pennsyvania crude oil is considered the ""best"" as far as refining is concerned with Permian Basin crude right behind it. Oil from the Middle East and other countries is high in sulphur content, hence the name ""sour"" crude because of that, including that from the Gulf of Mexico. Speaking of The Permian Basin, You fail to even mention it, getting off on something about George Mitchell and The Barnett Shale. The Permian Basin, centered in Midland-Odessa is where the bulk of most petroleum is pumped out in Texas. Thats about 300 miles center to center west from The Barnett Shale, think Fort Worth and Dallas here, which is famous for all that natural gas we extract and sell worldwide and other states in the Union including California, which does have  gas reserves but refuses to extract it along with massive offshore petroleum reserves off the coast of Santa Barbara. Instead, trying to be The Benchmark Eco-Green Leader in the nation, banned ANY new offshore extraction of petroleum. THAT, is why You Guys have to import your oil to the Chevron Refinery in El Segundo when there is probably an existing pipeline from the Santa Barbara offshore rigs except it aint got nothing in it because of the ban on any new exploration. You are wrong about Texas having the cheapest gasoline prices in the nation in the way you state. Yes, we do. But that difference is only 10 cents to 30 cents nationwide average. Cross into California from Nevada (which is 70 cents higher at 4 bucks a gallon) and it shoots up to $4.80 because of Caliifornia's state taxes.

The USA really picked up producing to export more oil in dollars so foreign banks have to buy our oil in dollars.

There is nothing backing the dollar.  What has kept it alive the last few decades is 80% of oil trade was purchased in dollars.

Ethnic Ukrainians killed: 33,999.. the only solution is to appoint a n ethnic Ukrainian as president. That way, the countries of Ukraine will break up along ethnic lines to the two main ethnicities: Russians and Ukrainians. Ukraine was created in 1783 by carving out land out of the Ottoman empire by the Romanov dynasty queen Katherine the Great. Officials of the Romanov dynasty preferred to call it Borderlands instead of Cossack lands, even though local Cossacks were in control of Kyiv since 1667 AD. That was about the same time that Europeans created a European homeland in the western hemisphere out of native American lands. Kyiv came under Cossack rule much earlier, in 1667. Cossacks claim that Kyiv was their homeland from 573 AD. Ukraine is a homeland for the Cossacks of present day Ukraine.

Us refinery's absolutely can run its own oil if it needed too, the strawberry and chocolate is nonsense but if you were going to continue using those terms there correct way would be. Chocolate is always cheaper to buy and for that reason the US will always continue to buy it and optimize its refineries for it. Strawberry can still be ran, just not as efficiently, and since its more expensive to start with there's no reason to put in projects in US refineries to optimize it. Also running lighter ""strawberry"" oil will produce more gas than diesel fuel, and diesel typically has a much better profit margin over gas in refining. We are set up to run nasty heavy crudes that a lot of places can't or simply done want too. In the case of Midwest refineries most of our stuff comes via pipeline from Canada and another significant amount from Texas. Its worth noting refineries typically don't just run one kind of oil, several different kinds are brought into tanks and then blended to whatever they want/need to meet market conditions.",2024-06-22T17:06:01Z

While it could be beneficial to just use our own, the purpose is to keep oil artificially cheap, while allowing ourselves to have time to build up domestic production of consumer goods which tend to be more expensive globally. Personally I believe we should shift our economic policies to be self sufficient, however the process to achieving that would be tricky because of how broad and diverse the American market is. Maybe the fastest way to achieve this would be to reduce industries that produce luxury or non essential goods, incentivize people to consume less, and to consume healthier foods.

Ugz7sGcndv00ZGPQmTJ4AaABAg,@jamesbradley3291,"Presentation, although somewhat informative, was over simplified. The real reason the US exports a lot of its oil is both for political reasons and partnership reasons because Texas oil is ‚Äúsweet‚Äù (low in sulfur) light oil (Saudi oil is also low in sulfur). Which must be combined and mixed with heavy oils (high in sulfur) in order to process heavy oils. Why heavy oils are necessary is because of the by products that are produced (ie. Refinement creates more waste by products that aren‚Äôt in light oils). As such, the US oil trading partners need our oil to dilute their heavy oils and in exchange the US gets the waste by-products the US needs. Given the world revolves around oil, Texas oil is in HUGE demand globally which puts the US in a great position to controlling and managing the US oil consumption needs and frees the US being controlled by OPEC countries. The Free World prefers the politics of the US over being controlled by the other OPEC countries. So the comment about the US having the wrong refineries is wholly incorrect and completely wrong. The US oil production is strategic and political, NOT a production issue or refinery issue. As for the new technology called ‚Äúfracking‚Äù, the US has HUGE oil reserves. But the oil was stuck in the various layers of porous shale rock. To release the oil out of this porous rock, it must be fractured. They do this by drilling down into the shale, then using high pressure water, it shatters the shale rock 360 degrees around the hole. This is the horizontal drilling being referred to. This frees up all the oil that was absorbed in the surrounding porous shale rock. Shale rock is nothing more than layers of compressed sand and sedimentary decomposed plant and fossil life materials. When shattered, the oils can flow, pool, and migrate to the well hole to try to escape the immense pressure of the overlying grounds.
As for refineries, there are basically 3 major locations due to access to waterways, California, Virginia (aka Department of Defense), and the Texas Gulf Coast; with Texas having the largest refineries with the largest oil ports and largest oil storage facilities (absent the US Government‚Äôs Strategic Oil Reserves stored in old underground Salt Domes).

Ugxb10QxBQByH1Exk9d4AaABAg,@frederickBays-bd5fz,"fracking: just what is it?  


Well it is where a corp takes some very bad chem, many of which only the the corp knows what they are, and mix them with nice pure water.  Then this now very bad water is pumped into the ground through a hole drilled in it.  Some of this very bad water comes back up and it is taken some place to dump and pollude wherever it is dumped.  Some stays in the ground and slowly makes it way into the groundwater.
I live just over the  boarder in NYS from where a lot of fracking has and is being done in PA.  The water they pull out of the ground comes out not only polluted with the chem put in it but when it comes out it is radioactive as this part of the world has a lot of radium in its shale.  They used to take this water and dump it in the Allegany River but when the states down stream got wind of what they were doing told them to stop or they would sue.  The corps tried to get some of this waste taken into nYS but we do not want it so that was our.   Not sure what they are doing with this highly polluted and radioactive water today but then most of the drilling has been done in PA and the gas and oil extracted.  They have been doing this in PA for over 30 yr close to 40 now.
Then we go out to OK where they dump the waste water into whatever creek is near by thus polluting the Mississippi in the long run and then the Gulf of MEX.  Now before the corps started fracking in OK it was very geologically stable.  Today they have an earthquake about once a week of 3.0 or higher with many more under 3.0 in between.  Texass is not any better.
Then there is the methane released when drilling.  It is so much that the gas taken is just as polluting as coal when u factor it in.
So more drilling is not the answer here.  The answer is more small hydro (under 100K/ unit) and wind with the same.  Solar can be used where it is good.  Goe thronnal is another but we dont have that many places it will work large scale.  Our biggest problem with energy is not that we dont have enough but where it is.   Our wind is mostly in the very lightly poped west of Miss R, and E of Rock M.  

Water we need to put in a 1M high hat damns to run a 1m 20K gen for 20Gw of constant power.

Wind we need to build 1M 1 to $5Mw mills to give us but 1/4 of max output of 250Gw to 1.25Tw.
we need to do this ww.

Cost for all of this will be over $50T closer to close to $500T

Ya it is a lot of money and little or none of it should go to the big corps but to the small land holders who own the land these things are put on",2024-05-30T21:31:03Z

Ugytz1x81lsUXkN-bZF4AaABAg,@paulkurilecz4209,"I think that you have the problem of crude types and refinery utilization a bit off.  When US light crudes were plentiful, the refineries used that as their feedstock.  As the production volumes declined, the refineries started looking for other sources of crude.  Some of that was domestic and others foreign.  When using heavier gravity crudes, additional processing steps are necessary to produce transport fuels.  These additional steps are various cracking processes and hydrogenation processes.  There is a tremendous amount of capital invested in these processes.  As heavy crude sources were sought, Venezuela was the first source as it is nearby but is low gravity crudes. But it was thought to be a stable, large volume source.  Once the Gulf Coast refineries were set up to process 25 degree API crude and lower gravity crudes, it doesn't mean that the refineries can no longer process the lighter crudes.  The result is that if the refineries were to process more of the lighter crudes, their upgrader processes would then be idled for lack of feedstock.  When Venezuela became politically unstable and production volumes began declining, the Gulf Coast refiners began sourcing crude from Canada and particularly the upgraded tar sands.  The upgraded tar sands are very similar to Venezuelan crude.  To put it into perspective, Venezuela once produced between 4 and 5 million barrels per day.  The last time I checked, it was producing about 600,000 barrels per day.

California is its own separate market as is Oregon and Washington.  California at one time exported crude and refined products.  The crude types in California were of the heavier gravities.  If I remember, the Kern River field near Bakersfield produced a 6 degree API crude.  As a result, California refineries have long been designed to process heavier crudes in the 10 to 20 degree gravity.

As an aside, the main reason why gasoline prices are so high in California as compared to the rest of the nation is the level of tax burden.  When I last checked, the total tax burden on gasoline in California is between $1.25 and $1.50 per gallon.  Additionally, CARB has placed very stringent emissions limits on refineries to the point where the refiners are considering closing down refineries rather than add the equipment to meet the emissions standards.  Chevron recently considered closing its Richmond refinery rather than meeting the new emissions standards.  If you want to compare gasoline prices in California, compare them to the prices in Oregon and Washington.

This was a rather simple explanation, but I think that I touched on some of the key aspects with regards to source and supply.  And actually, the last new refinery built in the US was at the former La Gloria OIl and Gas refinery in Tyler, Texas in 1978.  It had been a ~15,000 bpd refinery and a completely new refinery was built on the site with a capacity of ~60,000 bpd with the entire output being unleaded gasoline, diesel and jet fuel.  There were minor products such as petroleum coke and cut back asphalt.  There was a pipeline that connected the refinery directly to Barksdale AFB in Louisiana to supply the base with jet fuel.",2024-05-29T02:44:49Z

The  US problem at the moment is that we have light oil and its getting lighter, but these days we use a lot more diesel and kerosese jet fuel than we do gasoline.  We need heavy oil to make kerosene and diesel in the quantities that we need today.  The right heavier oil is also becoming more scarce.  Canada has heavy, but its very costly to produce, so that's not suitable.  Mexican heavy production is declining.  Venezuelan heavy is just too damned heavy.  Its solid at room temperature, so not even diesel components can be made with that.  Since US refineries are geared to process heavy, we take some of our light and mix heavy into it, resulting in some diesel and kerosene, but still not enough, so we import even more of those products to top off our very high demand for them.",2024-05-27T15:26:42Z

Climate alarmists are myopic with a singular focus on carbon dioxide.  Carbon DIOXIDE is plant food. It is a necessary ingredient when plant life use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water to convert it into OXYGEN through a process called photosynthesis. Eliminate it and we can't breathe. Or is that the goal? 

Carbon MONOXIDE is poisonous and is emitted from burning carbon-based fuels. Taken in sufficient quantity it is lethal. These are the emissions that must be reduced.

The US vehicle fleet has doubled in size since 2000, but demand for gas and diesel has fallen 40% in the same period, because the cars and trucks are much more efficient compared to 25 years ago, and because EVs are beginning to catch on. Consequently, the refineries that remain (every year a few close) are working at basically full capacity. So Donald's 'drill-drill-drill' is meaningless sloganeering. We don't have the refining capacity to process more oil, and it wouldn't affect the price of gas if we did, because the price of gas is based on the world price of oil which changes every day because of many factors beyond our control.",2024-05-01T16:30:29Z

I understand when emerging economies only latch on to renewables when they are cheaper than conventional energy, but for the richest most powerful country to not have played a major role in speeding up R&D and subsidize early rollout to create scale and bring down prices faster in the 2000 to 2015 timeframe is unforgiveable. Sure Australia too is just now coming to the table that PV is nice and cheap, but just imagine where we could be had decicive action been taken by the US in 2000.",2024-04-08T11:43:19Z
UgzMcpJG7ug-fnTozgl4AaABAg,@Aerospaceman,The United States purchases roughly 19% of sweet heavy crude oil from OPEC to be refined into the petroleum needs for the nation. The United States purchases oil from Canada and other producers to make up the difference. The US refuses to retool the refineries for light unsweetened oil which would much cheaper and the automotive industry refuses to produce lighter engines to burn a lighter fuel. Both refineries and engines would put less Sulphur into the atmosphere and their profits could show huge losses. Maybe they should put the people in the loop instead of hiding information.,2024-04-08T02:07:09Z

OPEC couldn't embargo the whole world without harming itself, so they only cut off the USA. So of course we could have paid for the oil someone *else* bought from OPEC and paid a middleman's markup. If we would have done this, we would have had prices but no shortage.

But we didn't. Instead we implemented a policy that made the embargo even more painful and damaging and helped OPEC in a way they couldn't have dreamed of.

Certainly batteries are no more ecologically viable than fossil fuels. Nuclear power may be the way forward, but half life of toxic waste measuring into the distant future is not a good thing. Perhaps cold fusion may work. However, how would that affect the global fiscal balance? For example.  Canada has all of the resources for all of these potential power requirements. Yet her economy is almost religiously tied to the US economy. Partly due to population and partly due to politics.",2024-03-20T14:05:16Z

Economics and environmental permits/regulations are driving 95% of the decisions.  It's just cheaper for a refinery to buy foreign oil than to spend $5 - 10 Billion (that's with a B) to convert just one refinery to American oil.  In addition, it can easily take 5 - 10 years to get the permits that would allow you to make the conversion.  And before the haters go off on ""Yeah but refineries make $10 Billion a day"" - they don't.  Seasonally and during maintenance they can easily lose $10 MM plus per month.  In addition, a refiner doesn't control the price of either its feedstocks or products, they float on their respective commodity markets so it's an incredibly high risk business with massive capital requirements and almost infinite liability.

Ugxa3lia-WMrfERIzah4AaABAg,@michaelschranz5666,"Here's something people don't know about oil prices.¬† Trump put the Saudis and Russia in a gas war. Making oil futures drop. As these prices from negative 35 and holding a negative 15 for months and up until they were positive 35 dollars, Trump topped off our stragic reserves, which were left half full under Obama Biden regime. And Biden is so keen on getting rid of, and selling off to other countries. On 4/20/2020 oil hit an all time low of negative 40 dollars per barrel for about 15 minutes. But for months they were literally paying for people to take oil, but you needed to be able to store said oil.¬† I remember seeing many miles on tanker rail cars parked on the railroad lines full of oil.

UgyAFm8Kk38WkW1A_5l4AaABAg,@SteelersHigh77,"All really interesting facts.  It goes to show you how illogical people can be about this subject.  I'm betting that many of these refineries are looking back wishing they had converted.  There is only going to be continued growth in petroleum usage as we grow until there is a legitimate and equally affordable alternative.  That doesn't exist enmass at this point.  No matter what, some of these people won't be happy until all oil wells are shut down.  They fail to realize that if you did away with using oil to power our vehicles, heat holes, (anything that burns it) it would raise the cost on all the hundreds of petro based products they buy, id estimate that it would more than quadruple their prices.  If oil companies don't have the incentive to make money in large quantity, they would scale operations back to a bare minimum which would throw prices through the roof.  Kinda contrary to supply and demand because there is still the exception when it comes to something like oil, not just anyone can obtain it.  But without the ability to make money by selling large quantities at low (relatively) low prices, now you would have just a small group of drillers willing to dp the work. I think anyone that honestly believes we will be oil free of fossil fuels in the next 25 years (short of the world ending or some major science breakthrough) are fooling themselves.  They have no idea how heavily dependent the world is and how much it would impact all of our lives negatively to make any drastic changes.  I'm not against always trying to do it better and cleaner.  

What a lot of people don't realize is that the idea of going completely green for automotive anytime in the near future is a pipe dream!  Just what it would cost on infrastructure change alone and the amount of additional power plants that would be needed.  It's not a hard thing to see, with all the Tesla's and other EVs on the road, I'm pretty sure it is still less than one percent.  They are already worried about the lithium and other rate earth metals that are unfortunately mostly found in China and other adversarial nations.  Could you imagine if tomorrow, magically everyone's vehicle was electric.  Not only would you need additional power plants and charging stations, but you also better start recruiting a new branch of the fire department that is dedicated to electrical/battery fires.  They are great and the more we can reduce emissions, great.  It's the right and responsible thing to do being that we have the technology and ability to do it.  At the same time there is a balance between wants and needs.  The immediate vs the future.  Quite honestly I can tell you that your generation was pumped full of climate fear porn.  People like Al Gore claiming the ice caps would be gone by 2010 if I'm not mistaken.  It was ""acid rain"" that as an 80s kid we were told was going to happen.  Gore and those still needing to leverage the climate for.political control did so as ""global warming"".  

I am not debating that we have some impact on the environment.  It is just nowhere near the levels that have been claimed.  More and more scientists are finally acknowledging that A. We have such a small recorded sample size of (detailed) weather data.  Especially when you are only talking about the period of time humans have been alive on Earth.  That is a drop in the bucket compared to the planets age.  and B. We have no real idea of the sun cycles and other things that have far greater of an impact than what we do.  Consider that in the 18th century, a volcano put the northern hemisphere in a mini winter for a few years.  We've never done anything comparable.  This planet proves it all the time, that it can shrug us off easier than you dusting an ant off yourself.",2024-03-04T14:50:38Z

The United States is the biggest oil producer in the world, but trades nearly one third of the oil it produces for foreign oil. Why can‚Äôt we use it ourselves and become energy independent? The answer is more complicated than you might expect.

We were energy independent while still maintaining environmental standards under Trump but Biden's extremist green policy regulations shut down oil and energy production in the US. There was denial of loans to domestic oil companies by Marxist democrat political green policies. Oil companies need loans to maintain operations. This denial of loans limits production and stops competition in the market making the US dependent on foreign oil. We can produce energy and refine it in the case of oil but the Marxist democrats when in power stop us by extremist regulations and make us dependent on foreign energy. Now refining oil and using it is another matter than producing oil and under Trump competition in the market drove down domestic energy prices by weeding out high priced domestic refined oil to foreign buyers or forcing them to lower prices to sell domestically.",2024-03-04T13:19:55Z

So, people should be happy about alternative sources of energy, as they postpone the time of peak oil/natural gas.  Alternative sources could also become cheap enough that they beat fossil fuels in head-to-head competition (in terms of costs).  Utilizing wind power alone has the potential capacity to create 10 or 11 times the energy production of what the world consumes in a year.  Considering all the other non-fossil forms available, the world has abundant non-fossil forms of energy that don't depend on combustion.  So, as YouTuibe fills up with more and more strident videos pushing pro and anti-fossil points of view, a competition is quietly taking place in the background.  The costs of some forms of energy are going up, while others are coming down.   Having to explore for,, drill, extract and refine/store your energy will become a big disadvantage soon.

One prime example, a lot of our gasoline and diesel fuel has to be made with imported crude from the North Sea (Brent Crude) because gasoline and diesel require light ""sweet"" crude which has a low sulfur content (sweet is used as a term for low sulfur crude).  The only oil fields in the US that produce that are in West Texas and Pennsylvania and those fields are mostly tapped out.  Fracking oil produced in the US is primarily heavy ""sour"" (high sulfur content) crude, which is fine for things like plastics, lubricants, etc but isn't economically feasible to refine into fuel.  Gahwar field (Saudi Arabia) crude is light ""sour"" crude so can be refined into fuel though the process is more involved and costly to make fuel that meets EPA/EU emissions standards, but can produce fuel cheaply for countries with no emissions laws.",2024-03-04T04:00:51Z
Ugyg2Sl1sQzK25oFqbZ4AaABAg,@robertkubrick3738,"Oil comes from WAY down. It's HOT down there. The liquid petrochemical gas you put in a car is actually a gas which as it cools condenses and becomes a liquid, natural gasoline. It doesn't really need refining, it would run an engine as is. What little refining it does get, is to optimize it for running in our engines. Now for the fun part! A standard barrel of oil is 42 US Gallons. But we can get 50 US Gallons of gasoline out of it plus some other products, NOT including the alcohol they might also mix in. Alcohol is virtually null for any engine not specifically set up to run alcohol and that is why your fuel mileage is so much worse, the more alcohol there is in your fuel. Brazil when they built cars to run on alcohol increased the compression ratio to 16 to 1 and that is Mack Diesel range. You have to squeeze alcohol hard to get the most out of it. Oil companies DO like alcohol though, it's an easy way to boost Octane. The natural gasoline spoken of earlier would be low octane and prone to detonation, so higher octane oil and alcohol are mixed in to get the desired octane.",2024-03-04T03:59:18Z

Even the oil drilled and produced in the US is still sold at international market price to refineries here in the US. 
People tend to fondly use the $2/gal figure, but the last time gas was at that level, global crude oil was going for $40/barrel. Due to expensive fracking and offshore drilling, $40/barrel is the minimum for US oil companies to make any profit. In 2015, a lot of oil companies were going bankrupt due to low crude prices.
Big oil companies spend billions of dollars to drill and produce oil, there is absolutely no way they will sell below international oil price just so that we have cheap gas. They'd gladly we blame the government for the high gas prices while they are raking in record profits. At the end of the day, its capitalism. Oil Companies will always sell their products at the highest permissible price (currently $76/barrel), even if that means $4/gal gas prices.",2024-03-04T03:17:52Z

If the so-called united states of america wants to defend the petrodollar policy for a long time and with it the centrality of the dollar within the global trade motion and the global economy (and this is regardless of whether this will be the last presidential election or the next) then I think it must :

1- fulfilling all its local needs from oil and natural gas, and this is a process that requires a few years to prepare and adapt the infrastructure for the transformation process, or rather expanding refining capabilitiesÿå Combined with achieving a boom in production that allows it to meet the needs of its allies in the major economies around the world, especially between nasty european continent and East Asia....

2- banning oil imported from abroad under two reasons:
1-the antitrust Law targeting OPEC, nations, companies, 
2-the central role of the saudi regime in the BLESSED September attacks,
I believe that the shock can occur and pass over close periods of time, 
for example, no one expected that the nasty europe would be able to implement its package of punishing policy's against Moscow and wean itself from Russian energy products in this short period of time, while the so called united states of america is in much better position regarding the security of energy sector compared with the nasty european continent...

3- Investing in the Russian and Chinese threats with the aim of trading the continuing the security commitment for european continent and  far East and South east Asia in exchange of  monopolizing the energy markets in the nasty european continent and in the far East and South east Asia, this assumes the creation of the Russian threat on the direct borders of the european continent by enabling Moscow to gain military control over Ukraine, Of course, in violation of international conventions, customs and laws, by keep this crisis open, allowing the so-called united states of america to maintain its recent achievement in Russia from the european energy market.
then the possibility for the so-called united states to withdraw from nato alliance, combined with openness to Moscow as a major source of energy production and virgin land with huge investment opportunities where the trade balance between the so-called united states of america and the european union tends in favor of the latter, On the other hand, Russia is a raw land and is considered in many of its cities and vital sectors underdeveloped, beside Russia could play great role in balancing the energy sector outside the costly gcc countries ,
this will place the european continent before very difficult choices, starting with a huge defensive bill to meet the security requirements of major existential threat's, at least they will go back to the same spending level in the periods leading to the ww2, those challenges may lead either to gathering the nasty european countries together and building european army but with the contradictions and historical scars coupled with the strategic imbalance in terms of france‚Äôs monopoly of nuclear weapons on the european continent, on the other hands with two world wars under its belt, a proven record of committing genocide crimes, coupled with the nasty nature of a very nasty people's, there is an impossibility in allowing the nasty germans to possess nuclear weapons, or it lead to the dissolution or at least the shrinkage of the nasty european union, and with it the liquidation of the euro as a global currency for a political and economic block... 

will not go into the benefits and advantages of investing in the manufacturing of Chinese threats in the far East Asia, in dominating the energy sector for that highly developed highly demanding region.


the monopoly of energy markets in the industrialized world by the so-called united states of america in exchange with the continues security Commitment in the face of the emerging Russian and Chinese threat's, this will lead to the collapse of energy prices due to the shrinking markets size combined with abundant supply, and within ten years to the dismantling of the OPEC bloc, and defending the petrodollar policy and with it the centrality of dollars in the movement of international trade and with it the global economy...

Once again, I believe that this presidential election or the one after it in the so-called united states of america is the last presidential election in this geography, meaning at best case we are witnessing the last decade in the life of the so-called united states of america...",2024-03-04T01:16:24Z

The truth is there are forces within the US and beyond who want the US to produce oil and those who do not, one of which are OPEC who don't want the competition and want the West to consume its produced oil. 

This has a whole geopolitical dimension and Biden was not doing what is in the US or its own population's best interest, nor, really, the planets, as yes the Electric and other so-called Green initiatives are in fact not so Green and in fact can and will turn out to be more harmful and polluting in the end.

They can start by modeling the behavior they want state power to enforce on everyone else. Live by example John Kerry. Changes starts by you looking in the mirror. Hope starts when you Hope the states ban private jets. Instead of a ban on Assault Rifles, push for a ban on Gulf Stream private Jets. 

Evangelical Gospel of Wealth preachers, Climate Change Czars, entertainers like Tracy Morgan, and those who are jealous like Howard Stern (but who could afford to literally get their own private jet) all will not appreciate these limitations, nor being demonized as foul humans for demanding their privilege of flying whereever they want whenever they want and doing so privately, not having to wait in lines at the airport like common folk. 

Serious climate change initiatives start there and expand. It also acknowledges that you cannot force everyone to go electric without doubling or tripling the capacity of the electric grid, and pre-manufacturing the electrical vehicles BEFORE mandating that everyone must get one. 


That is how you know it is all a scam since if everyone wanted an electric car there are not enough to provide them. It would just create a mandatory artificial demand and not enough supply and this will lead to some jacked up messed up ""that's not right' economic inequality outcomes.

Unless the Greeners start talking seriously about nuclear power to replace fossil fuel they are pissing in the wind literally. Both solar and wind power are unsustainable and unreliable. Right now they can't build enough turbines to replace the ones that are reaching end of service life (roughly twentyfive years). Solar arrays are also not a infinte power, they also only have a finite service life. Solution is ease all bureaucracy around new refineries and modernazation of current ones. Apply emission standards for fossil fueled power generation that rewards lower emissions. Get rid of all cap and trade regulation (it's a Ponzi scheme).",2024-03-03T16:31:12Z

The result of this is the drastically increasing cost of production in the USA making it unprofitable. In short, it is currently cheaper to refine our oil overseas and pass on the shipping cost to the citizens of the USA through higher and constantly increasing prices. 
When the Federal government became overly involved in the oil industry and created short-sighted laws, rules, and regulations with unrealistic/idealistic goals, they created a Gordian knot of national and international coorperate and government entanglements that have ultimately weakened the USA. And just like Alexander the Great, the only way to untie this knot is to cut it by carefully examining the pros and cons of each, eliminating the unreasonable restrictions, and keeping only what is truly needed. 
Identifying shortcomings and setting goals to correct them is a good idea. But setting an unrealistic goal is like creating a set of stairs that are three times your height.

*Why Does the US Have Oil But Still Buy It From Other Countries?*

* *The US used to get most of its oil from other countries.*  They
  were like friends who always traded snacks.
* *Then the US found ways to get its own oil at home!*  This is like
  finding out you can grow your own snacks in the backyard.
* *But the US oil is a different kind than what it used to buy.* It's
  like growing strawberries instead of the usual chocolate.
* *The places that make stuff out of oil (like gas for cars) are only*
  *set up for the old chocolate kind.*  These are like picky eaters
  that only like chocolate snacks.
* *It would cost a lot of money to change them so they can use the*
  *strawberry oil.* Think of this like having to buy a whole new
  kitchen to cook your homegrown snacks.
* *So, it's cheaper to just send the strawberry oil to other countries*
  *with picky eaters like us, and buy the chocolate kind from other*
  *places.* It's like trading your strawberries for chocolate with a
  friend who loves them!

*Other things to know:*

* *A long time ago, people got worried about running out of oil.*
  It's like worrying your snack supply will disappear.
* *The US wants to make sure it always has enough energy (like*
  *snacks!) so it gets some from friends like Canada.*
* *Even though the US makes a lot of oil, we still need to use less*
  *because it's better for the planet.*  This is like trying to eat
  healthier snacks, even if you sometimes need a treat!



*Abstract*

The video explores the US oil industry's complex dynamics despite its
recent production surge.  Historically, the US was heavily reliant on
foreign oil. This changed dramatically due to technological
advancements in fracking, making the US a top oil producer.  However,
a significant portion of domestically produced oil is exported, and
the US still imports oil.  The reasons for this include:

* *Mismatched Oil Types:* US fracking yields oil that isn't always
  compatible with existing US refineries, which were designed for a
  different oil type.
* *Economic Factors:* It's often cheaper to import oil that matches a
  refinery's specifications than to retool refineries for domestically
  produced oil.
* *Energy Security vs Independence:* The focus has shifted from
  complete energy independence (which is unrealistic) to energy
  security. This means diversifying sources, often involving imports
  from reliable partners like Canada.

The video concludes that even with increased production, reducing oil
use is essential to address climate change.

Prices are rigged everywhere. Even gas station to gas station.

The US MUST stop basing our consumer prices on 'what other pay in the world'.
No more world market prices!
We get screwed every time.

Want to stop using oil? Your choice. But YOU cannot dictate squat to me. I want CHEAP reliable oil, gas, gasoline, and electricity, and abundantly.

That Solar PV not only takes care of the load of the EV, but typically the entire house, and since most is Grid Tied, surplus is sent up to the Grid.  Net effect of all that is ALL the EVs are cancelled out in terms of over Grid Load, and the long-term trend ahead is for REDUCED Grid Load, as the Solar PV can all be used locally, at or near the site.   

Meanwhile US Nukes have been shutting down since 2012 -- ""Peak Nukes"" for US with 104 Reactors.  Now US is down to 94 Reactors, with the prior losses not even missed.  So the look-ahead is more Nukes will shut down as they age-out and go off-line, with few-to-none New Nukes being built.  Nukes have become so unprofitable, they have all been put on Production Tax Credits (energy welfare) this last year, just to keep from bankrupting off-line early.   

Building surplus Solar is far cheaper than batteries, so US will probably continue build-out Solar PV to saturate the daytime market with coast-to-coast Grid Tied Solar, and there is no point to storing any, because a fresh batch of Sunshine comes up every morning.  And finally, as EVs continue to expand, the existing refineries will go more-and-more surplus, and drop out, as well.",2024-03-02T21:36:22Z

Canada has the third largest oil reserves in the world. President Trump approved the Keystone XL pipeline which was under construction when President Biden canceled the international border permit for Keystone XL. That actually hurt a lot of towns and cities that were gearing up for the pipeline boost to their economies, a lot of people building and supplying the pipeline needs lost their jobs. Canada is in the process of completing a new pipeline from Alberta to Tidewater in British Columbia which will allow for international shipping of oil by oil tankers. You mentioned California, well the problem in California is the sulphur content in California oil. The highest sulphur-content domestic crude oil is not used in California it is shipped to India. So some of that oil from Canada's new pipeline will go to California. California actually claims carbon credits when they use Canadian oil sands oil as it is a lower sulphur content oil than California oil. Canada also requires lighter oils that they primarily import from the USA. Actually, the oil industry b/w Canada and the US work very well together making sure refined petroleum products are available on both sides of the border. It depends on proximity to refineries as it costs money to ship gasoline. So in some geographic areas, the US ships gasoline to Canada and Canada ships gasoline to US cities. Remember too that Canada has conventional oil as well as oil sands oil.  
   Oil is not just used for refining into gasoline, diesel fuel, naphtha etc. The US has massive petrochemical plants that also use oil. Vehicle tire's primary ingredient is oil, think about asphalt shingles on your roof, waterproofing in construction, plastics, clothing etc. So frankly we will never stop using oil.

Ugz0wr2_p4UvuTbCnfJ4AaABAg,@deaddocreallydeaddoc5244,"The best solution for the future of energy supply is the construction of Molten Salt Thorium Reactors.  Besides providing abundant, electricity, they can provide a myriad of other functions that will completely defuse the Green Agenda.  The so-called renewables actually do more harm than good because of the mining and toxins involved in their production and the waste they produce. It is possible to keep the current transportation infrastructure in place.  For example, synthetic gasoline production has been made a reality.  This is a carbon-neutral process of capturing carbon and reconstructing the gasoline by adding Hydrogen, recovered from atmospheric capture means that we can shrink that atmospheric (and oceanic)carbon.  MSRs can make this happen in realistic quantities.  They can be built on existing power plant sites, like coal or diesel plants, and use the same already existing power grids.  MSRs can be made small enough to run a car, ship, or train.  They can be used to desalinize ocean water on a massive scale.  They cannot melt down because the molten salt is the fuel carrier.  Thorium is preferred over Uranium because it has 200 times more energy potential and is dirt cheap.  Thorium is abundant and has been the ""waste"" product of rare earth mining.  The reaction occurs between 600-800 degrees F.  Molten Salt's boiling point is 1,200-1,400.  If the molten salt should ever overheat the reaction stops and a freeze plug in the bottom of the fuel jacket melts and the molten salt flows into a holding tank where it cools down naturally.  The traditional Light Water Uranium Rector requires extensive and expensive pressure systems to get the water hot enough for the reaction to occur and then cool it down again.  MSRs require none of this, making itsfar less expensive and safer to run since all the meltdowns that have occurred have been due to a failure of the cooling systems.  MSRs can be set up to burn the waste from light water uranium reactors because they are so efficient.  They can be used for producing non-carbon diesel fuels.  They can be used to cheaply desalinate seawater, and scrub carbon from the atmosphere.  They are safe and can be built anywhere. because they don't need water in any aspect of their operation.  They can be made small enough to power a car or big enough to power a city.  The U.S. has about t a dozen companies that are either ready or near ready to construct them   France is developing them and Denmark has one company developing them.  I don't know about Germany, but Germany would clearly benefit from them and could erect them quickly if desired.  They must get over their anti-nuclear sickness, however.  There is no time to waste.  here is a four-minute introductory video to MSRs. -

UgxjEQ9Aoy2K1zboy6t4AaABAg,@WayneGreen-g8l,"This is why we had to make up lies about WMD in Iraq and invade them in 2003. They were selling their oil for Euro instead of using the Petro-dollar and we needed their type of oil. 
  In the late 1990s, US negotiations with the Taliban broke down for building pipelines across their country so we could challenge Russia's and Iran's pipelines. Later in 2001, we used 9/11 as an excuse to invade and conquer Afghanistan. If all we had wanted was to do was to kill Osama bin Laden, we could have just used commandos like we ended up doing anyways.
  Also in the 1990s, the UN stated that US actions in Iraq had caused the deaths of 500,000 children from 1991 to 1995 and Madeleine Albright responded saying, it was ""worth it."" I saw that and wondered, what was worth it? Getting Kuwaiti oil back on the market?
   When we conquered Afghanistan, though, the Afghan resistance made it impossible for us build our pipelines where we had planned. Then, in 2008, the housing bubble burst, hydraulic fracturing went through the roof, I lost a software engineering job with a custom home construction company and went to work for a major unconventional gas company. But the increase in natural gas gave us enough gas to challenge Russian and Iranian gas exports and hurt them, or so we thought. 
  So, we lost interest in Afghanistan and started looking for a way out of there and out of Iraq too - pesky civilians and their guerrilla tactics are so annoying. Don't they realize how awesome and entitled we are? Why doesn't everyone just want to be like us? 
  Anyhow, we paid off the Iraqi resistance, gave them concessions, claimed that it was our meager ""surge"" that made them quit, and allowed Iran install Iraqi politicians friendly to them in Baghdad in exchange for Iraq selling oil in dollars. We declared the job done, democracy installed, reduced our presence in Iraq, and began work on destabilizing Syria by aiding terrorists against Al-Asad. (Wait, hadn't we already aided terrorist Mujahadin in Afghanistan against the USSR in the 1980s?) Then DAESH rose to power and we had an excuse to put troops in Syria to steal their oil - which we're still doing. Russia responded by sending troops to Syria too, and so did Iran. US troops, DAESH terrorists, US-backed terrorists, Iranian military advisors, Syrian troops, Russian troops, and Hizbollah all partying in one country. Hmm, if only Israel would start bombing - then all the kids would be there.
  Meanwhile Iran finished building its oil bourse, got that working, finished their nuclear power plant with the help of Russia, and began exporting weapons they had started domestically building from their then nascent arms manufacturing industries.
  Then, after we bombed some more Afghan villages and weddings (why doesn't everyone automatically just love us?) we made a deal with the Taliban, sold out the people we promised we were there to help, and high-tailed out of there.
  So, fast-forward to where we are now. Our sanctions on Russia and Iran have backfired. Russia is selling gas to Europe in Rubles instead of Euro while increasing its oil sales to India and China. Saudi Arabia started selling oil to China in Yuan while China got them to shake hands with Iran.
  We raised interest rates and made a bunch of banks fail (again) while we keep going further into debt (over $34 trillion now) throwing money at Ukraine to lose a war to Russia, throwing money at Israel, arming and funding them to slaughter civilians even more than they used to. And the New York Times gets exposed for printing fake news about supposed Hamas atrocities. (Tell me again why everyone doesn't love us? Why are so many countries dumping our Treasury bills and choosing to trade in local currencies instead of our dollars?) Then Yemen joined the war on the side of Palestinians.
  Meanwhile, Iran has joined BRICS and the SCO, is gaining international acceptance, is building a second nuclear power plant, putting satellites into orbit, and increasing its economic/military/cultural/educational/technological/financial cooperation with Russia.
   China is catching up in the semiconductor technology because we put sanctions and embargos on CPUs to them and they decided to invest more in microchips and started manufacturing a 5G smart phone while gaining popularity in the world.
  Meanwhile we continue to be the only country vetoing UN resolutions against Israel just like we vetoed a UN resolution against Saddam for gassing Kurdish civilians but later claimed that it was his chemical weapons that we were worried about. But everyone in the world still trusts us too, right?
  We've started bombing Yemen which made them even more determined. Russia has started protecting Syria from Israeli air attacks by blocking Israeli missiles, while Hizbollah and Israel trade fire across the Lebanese border and we're threatening to get involved even further.",2024-03-02T16:08:45Z

UgzLeqqE96J6iXRGuk14AaABAg,@abqmalenurse,"I have been pointing this out for years. Oil is one of the US's top three exports but also one of our top three IMPORTS. 
One reason is that WTI grade crude is virtually useless for diesel fuel and other heavy products. Most large scale transportation and freight rely on diesel. Trucks, trains, buses, boats, barges all use diesel. 
Yes, we could get diesel from WTI but it takes far more processing, which is far more expensive. Then you also divert oil refining from gasoline to diesel, reducing the gasoline supply and driving up the cost of gasoline and other products. 
When oil increases in price, it causes EVERYTHING else to go up. 
Know who else uses lots of diesel? The US military. More than any other entity on earth. More than most countries.

California policy has made it so difficult to pump oil out of the ground that there is no economic way it can compete with foreign oil. The Biden administration's ban on expanded pipelines means that any additional domestically sourced oil absolutely cannot be used in America as the transfer apparatus is already at capacity. The Biden promise to shut down the fossil fuel industry in 10 years means that there is no reasonable source of funds to modernize existing refineries. The Jones Act also prevents domestic oil from being moved by ship to excess refining capacity and there is only so much trains and trucking can do while still making any economic sense.

And if any exporters try to jack us over by hikimg oil prices, we just say ‚Äúfrak you,‚Äù and immediately collapse their export market by stopping oil imports and dipping into our massive reserves.

Easy peasy.  Whatever; as long as we end up with all or most of the oil left in the planet within our borders when the rest of the world runs out.  We‚Äôll still need a lot of gas for our military, industry, and economy (and our SUVs and pickups, and heat and hot water) to ensure our security when everyone else gets desperate.  We can use that remaining oil to (finally) transition to nuclear; also solar and wind - perhaps the technology will be mature enough by then to actually use them to generate and store electricity.  You know, use solar and wind when it makes economic and practical and technological sense to do so, rather than having politicians and corrupted scientists and ignorant activists forcimg an energy policy because they need votes, and to sleep blissfully not realizing that forcing immature technologies down our throats is actually causing far more environmental harm, damage, and destruction than oil is.

Ps:  I‚Äôm not some pro-petroleum nut, nor a pro-nuclear nut, nor am I an anti-wind and anti-solar nut - frankly, I could give a shit where my energy comes from.  I‚Äôm also not a pro- or anti-climate nut - sure, I care about the environment and pollution.  Who doesn‚Äôt.  If it‚Äôs definitively proven either that humans are impacting the climate or we‚Äôre just experiencing normal climate activity, I really don‚Äôt worry about it much.  I think it would be a good idea to try and reduce certain gas emissions (in fact, those super nasty gases were reduced by more natural gas usage, and reduced far more than solar or wind ever have done - a clear indication that using fossil fuels isn‚Äôt‚Äôbad‚Äô).  I also think we need to keep awareness of the environment in mind and regulated, which I think we already do a pretty good job at.  Good Lord, we don‚Äôt meed MORE regulations; please just use the ones we already have (in triplicate, probably).

 But for the love of Christ, please use intelligence when preparing for an energy transition, and have a PLAN!  Energy policy is HUGE for the US, at least as, if not more, important than national security policy. It will take decades to get this infrastructure built up and working; please try to understand we‚Äôre going to need to use fossil energy during this entire time‚Ä¶and that doing so isn‚Äôt a bad thing.  I‚Äôm absolutely not saying we should base policy decisions solely on the market, but the market needs to be an overwhelmingly significant factor - a helluva bigger influence than some ex-barista-turned-crazy anti-everything-American activist.",2024-03-01T06:01:41Z

UgyT9ZQdEt9yA1we7oB4AaABAg,@PhattGreg,"Hi @MorningBrew, 
Being a climate scientist, and having learned about the fossil fuel industry, there are several big mistakes made in the video, that should be addressed.  

Whilst seeing the industry end regarding Global Warming, being accurate also is important, as its not the case that the refineries cant process the oil, which is high grade oil, and commands a high sale price. 

It‚Äôs because of what‚Äôs added to the low grade oil imported into the US, called Skunk oil, which is rich in sulphur,mis the problem. 

The two oil types are vastly different, when it comes say, making gasoline, with high grade oil, which has no sulphur, so can be made into gasoline, without needing any additives.  Where as Skunk oil, due to the sulphur, that causes two serious problems.  

Engine Knocking, where the sulphur causes premature ignition, and other problems during the ignition process, even in diesels.  Lowering performance and increased wear on the engine. 

The other issue is increased decarbonisation cycles, as the sulphur and carbon bond to each other, requiring a decarbonisation cycle weekly or at least monthly to remove the buildup of crud in the engine. 

So Lead was added, which bonds with the Sulphur, only melting away later in the combustion cycle. However when it comes to unleaded fuel, Cobalt us used instead of lead, with a higher melting point and adverse issues relating to the creation of airborne smog and rising asthmah cases. 

The simple answer is that the High grade fuel, could be refined in the US just as easily, with the real issue related to tar sand oil, which has more impurities than skunk oil. 

But that fuel would be significantly more expensive, and it‚Äôs more profitable to sell skunk oil in the US.  

Regarding the economics of it, the price difference in quality, is so great that you can fly it and still make a hefty profit on the high grade oil!",2024-03-01T03:51:57Z
