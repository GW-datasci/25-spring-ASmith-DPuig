Played it in Munich with friends, the friends only had to update their location every 12 or 13 minutes or so. It worked out well because there are bus lines, that take you as far as subway lines, as well as tram lines, that have more stops but take you around the neighborhood and low speed rail, that can take you to outskirts. Also, all of that is connected through one app on your phone in Munich. 

A lot of fun! And as a newcomer (new student) in the city, you get to know where you‚Äôre going real fast.",2022-09-28T12:07:09Z

First I would do extensive research bring clothes that appropriately match the culture of each individual area and find not the fastest but maybe a place that they would not know how to go to unless they did well research wich i would have done maybe a backwater airport or train service. Next for my costume I would wear some things that would go against my physical features such as glasses or a wig I would maybe get these at a shop then I would spend my available time outside a barber making it seem on the tracker I changed my hair while I was their I would sort the items that I had available ranking them most to least important and separate them as such in the bag from most important at the top to least important at the bottom.

With about 600km from the starting point to the finish lines that should be enough time to get all the way there. It would be very difficult to catch someone on a bike and tag them and they could travel through rural areas which chasers would have trouble getting to without another bike.

If they notice Sam heading towards Cervinia or Valtournenche they can get to the glacier and ski down to Valtournenche and wait for Sam there.

Edit: I looked it up, which took 2min at most, here is what I found: In Colorado (USA) it is illegal to cross a road/street as a pedestrian anywhere else then at intersections and/or crosswalks. (Which in my eyes is a rule against humans and for cars, which is inherently problematic, but that is beside the point.)
In France however, and thereby also in Calais, it is legal to cross any street anywhere you please unless it is directly in front of a moving vehicle. (which would be stupid anyways).
Therefor: Cross any street *not* at an intersection or crosswalk and check off the challenge.",2022-09-22T10:51:57Z

Unless he takes a ferry to Dover. Which he could conceivably do, then take the Eurostar to Paris. I think this is less likely though, because if Ben and Adam see him on that ferry, they will know immediately what his plan is, and could just go to Paris to intercept. It's a logistics game at that point. The ferry is 90 minutes, and the fastest train to Paris another 120, so that's 3.5 hours, and he'll definitely have to do multiple challenges in Dover (the ferry will cost him 900 coins, but the high-speed train will be 3,000 coins, so even though he'd get 750 coins in Dover for completing the curse card, he'd have to add just over 1,300 coins in Dover to pay for a ticket to Paris).

You know...it would almost make more sense to take the ferry to Dover, then take a train to London. He could do a whole bunch of challenges in London and then, after accumulating a lot of coins, he could FLY somewhere, ideally somewhere that has a good rail pathway to Zermatt. The upshot is that there would be no point for Ben and Adam to go to London to catch him. It'd be pointless, because a) once they realize Sam is going to London, it would likely take them a few hours to get there after him, and b) once they got to London, Sam could pick any one of London's 3 major airports to disembark from...or he could even take the Eurostar BACK to France and psych them out. Better to stay still in France and wait for him to return to the continent.",2022-09-21T01:17:11Z

Ugxn-vYugDi0dsnRluJ4AaABAg,@mfogs1767,"My thoughts on strategy:

Head to Germany ASAP. Germany has public bike sharing (Call a Bike) across ~40 cities. It's unclear whether you can pick up a bike in one city and drop it off in another. If you can, great, that makes things easier‚Äîbut if not, simply bike out into the countryside and start racking up challenges in obscure locations (this part would work in any city that has public bike sharing, not just DE). Start by biking along a major train route for 45 min so it looks like you're on the train (choose a low speed one so your speed looks conceivable; they may sniff this out). Choose a stop as far away that has no bike share and you can get there before they do on the next public transit. Stay there until the next public transit from the starting point departs. Then take off in a direction that has no public transit with your bike. Start racking up challenges, bouncing from place to place that doesn't have easy public transit opportunities in a randomized manner. 

You'll get a TON of points this way. Then - they know you'll have to return to the same city to return your bike. But rather than choosing the main train station or something, find an alternate departure point (e.g. intra-city bus stop, smaller train station, etc.). Get there max 5 min before your departure, fly off into the sunset. Granted, you could still be caught, BUT you have so many more options incl flights for later on based on how many pts you racked up. 

I don't have access to the full rules, but this seems possible based on what's been stated so far (but who knows they're pretty good about rules so it may not be possible). You would obviously have to be a very strong biker as well (I've done ~50 miles on a citi bike and it was a nightmare lol).",2022-09-15T13:59:50Z

*SECRET MESSAGE:* _Great move by Sam and Ben for figuring out where Adam would be (and to be honest, he didn't get as far and close as he wanted it be), but Sam pulling out the curse card has completely changed the game._

_Sam cannot afford to get caught so deep in Ben's territory because if he does, the game will be over. (And that won't be great for content viewing, right?) If he decides to keep the curse card and knows where he wants to go, that will go a long way towards achieving total victory at the end of the three days playing tag across Europe._
